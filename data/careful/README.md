Three columns, space separated.  First column is CNOT depolarisation rate, second column is Toffoli rate/CNOT rate, third column is least positive preparation error rate such that output error rate = preparation error rate.  Idle qubits depolarise with probability 0.1%.  These data files did not use the heuristic that output error rate is an increasing function of preparation error rate, and found the least fixed points by stepping from 0.
