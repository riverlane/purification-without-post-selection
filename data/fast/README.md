Three columns, space separated.  First column is CNOT depolarisation rate, second column is Toffoli rate/CNOT rate, third column is least positive preparation error rate such that output error rate = preparation error rate.  Idle qubits depolarise with probability 0.1%.  These data files were generated using the heuristic that output error rate is an increasing function of preparation error rate.
